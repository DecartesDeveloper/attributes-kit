# Attributes Kit [![Circle CI](circleci-badge)](circleci)

Attributes Kit is a (as the name suggest) kit which helps you with rendering [MSON](https://github.com/apiaryio/mson) (plain-text, human and machine readable, description format for describing data structures).

For instanceâ€”it turns the following...


```Markdown
- id: 1
- name: A green door
- price: 12.50
- tags: home, green
```

...into this.

# Usage

## Installation

```
npm install attributes-kit
```

### Browser

You can still `npm install attributes-kit` and use the package in the browser; with [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) it's a piece of cake.

If you prefer to drop a `<script>` tag in your page, here's a list of browser builds that you can use. All builds do support [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) ([AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) and [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS)) out of the box; there are both uncompressed and compressed versions, the compressed one comes with a source map file.

| Uncompressed            |
|:------------------------|
| [`attributes-kit.js`]() |
| The uncompressed file is best used during development or debugging. |

| Compressed                   |
|:-----------------------------|
| [`attributes-kit.min.js`](); [`attributes-kit.min.map`]() |
| Compressed version saves bandwidth and improves performance in production. Source map, the file is not required to run the Kit. |

In case you would like to build your own version of the Attributes Kit, please see the [Custom Builds](#custom-builds) section.
